# Wax

A program for cataloging and playing recordings.

## Installing

Use the installer program to install Wax and its companion program WaxConfig. See the README in the wax-install repository for instructions on how to use the installer.

## Getting Started

The manual is available at [readthedocs](https://wax-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html).

For an overview of Wax, read the blog post at [Archimago](https://archimago.blogspot.com/2024/10/guest-post-raspberry-pi-music-system.html). There are two articles about hardware for complete solutions. One uses a [HiFiBerry DAC](https://jeffbarish.github.io/). The [other](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/a-low-cost-music-server-with-high-resolution-metadata.61191/) has two implementations, one using a HiFiBerry DAC again, the other a NanoSound One DAC with the Argon One M.2 case.

There is also a thread about Wax at MusicBrainz [Forum](https://community.metabrainz.org/t/using-wax-for-cataloging-and-playing-a-music-collection/687954).

Wax has a companion program, MiniWax, which makes it possible to play music from your collection from any platform with a browser.
